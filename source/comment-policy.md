# Privacy Policy

Updated: 08-18-2023

Welcome to my Personal Github Pages site here at Github Pages, my name is Dustin. I like to write blog posts on various Tech related topics, mainly with javScript and various library and frameworks such as threejs but just about everything is possibly on the table if it enters my radar sort of speak. Anyway this is my comment policy when it comes to commenting on this site, I will try to keep this to the point.


## Comments should be relevant to the content of the post

I might have to reject comments if the message is not relevant to the the content of the post. This will be loosely enforced however as I find that there is a whole lot of overlap with things. For example if you aim to write about something that has to do with Buffer Geometry on my post about materials in general, I might still allow it as there is a great deal of overlap between geometry and materials. Still it might be best to comment on my post on buffer geometry in general, or a more specific post on geometry. It is okay to go off the rails a little, but try to say on topic.

## Links need to be approved and should be relevant to the content of the post

I need to approve links because I can not have people just posting links to all kinds of various places on the open wild Internet of course. The nature of the content that you are linking to should relate to over all topic of the blog post. For example if YOU have wrote your own blog post on ffmpeg, and you want to have a link in the comments section of MY blog post on ffmpeg you are golden. If you want to promote your Multi Level Marketing scam, spread misinformation on an aspect of reality that has been politicized, it should go without saying that I will not approve it.

I might have to also remove links that are just linking to all kinds of random resources such images, and scripts in code examples. As such it might be best to place code in a jsfiddle, or some alternative to that, and then link to that.
