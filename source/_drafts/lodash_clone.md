When dealing with objects in javaScript often I just need to create them, and reference them, but some times I may want to copy one. In native javaScript there is [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign), but there is poor browser support, so \_.clone is a useful method that is useful in lodash to help allow for better browser support with cloning.
