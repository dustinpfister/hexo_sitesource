After being a JavaScript hobbyist for some ten years, and working on a whole lot of prototypes, I have come to understand a problem of sorts. I have never made anything that I am truly happy with. This is common with developers from what I have gathered, and often the only cure for it is to buckle down and crank out a really awesome project that people including but by no means little to myself will truly enjoy. Sometimes it will come in the form of a project that is useful in some way, however often it is just something that is amusing such as a game.

## The problem of working on just one game.

If you think you truly have an idea for a game that is worthy of such a large investment of time I say go for it. I think I might have one or two ideas for games that may be worthy of such an investment myself. However at the moment there are a lot of barriers keeping me from working on that kind of project, and no it's not just the usual life drama. When I spend a great deal of time working on a project a little at a time, once I start to go beyond a month or so with it I start to freak out a little. I ask myself "I just spent a great deal of a month working on this, was it worth it?". As such often the answer to a question like that is no, and I move on to a new project. There are other concerns that come to mind, but this is by far the big one I would say.

## The problem of working on whole bunch of game prototypes.

It's easy to understand whats wrong with this as well. When I overextend myself across to many projects, each project does not receive the level of attention that it deserves it order to have any chance at coming even close to something that can be considered a final product. This has been my sin with game dev for years, I have to admit that it is better to have one great game, than 100 or so sub par prototypes. It is not completely idiotic though, in the process of doing so I do think I have gained a certain something when it comes to exploration, for what it's worth.

## The solution: Concentrate on four games prototypes, and make them each solid.

Find a happy medium by making four games at once, thats the plan for now. The idea here is that if I feel as though I have spent to much time working on one, I can change focus to another. However when doing so I keep it reserved to a small collection of just four titles. Another great point is that of the four at least one should be a smash hit, or failing that one that people hate the least for sure.

## The Games

### Dig

Dig is a game about digging in a lot of land to gain an in game currency I call pebble. The idea for it came to me when I was thinking about the differences between lateral, and linear thought. At version 2.15.0 as of this writing dig is so far the most solid of the four game ideas, but can still use a whole lot of polish.

### Off Grid

This is a survival type kind of game. For years I have thought about doing what I need to do to pursue a simplified minimalistic lifestyle. I really like this game idea the most of the four at the moment, so as of late it has been receiving more attention form me as I would like to get it to the point where it is at least as solid as dig. This game may prove to be a bit time consuming

### Clad Clash


### Forever Stupid

No you have any re occurring nightmares? I do, mine is one in which I spend my whole live repeating senior year of high school. As such "Forever Stupid", I figure, is a great title for a game that reflects such a condition. I have a feeling that working on a game like this could prove to be a lot of fun, and after all a game should be just that.

## A common ground:

The games will share certain things in common such as:

* They will be HTML 5 games.
* I will be building them on top of the popular phaser framework.
* All games will have a 1.x branch that reflect the state of there original vanilla js prototype roots, that may or may not continue to be supported.
* They will all contain at least one animation that I have made with my animation framework I call forFrame.js

In addition elements that I development may be shared across games. If something that I make will work great in another game, I will likely tie it into it somehow.

## Following up on progress

All four of the games will be hosted here at my site. I will be updating this post, as well as write new posts here about progress maybe at least one per week. If all goes well in a few months I should have a nice little solid set of games, that just keep getting even better.
