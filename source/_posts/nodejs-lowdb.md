When it comes to database solutions that are popular in a node.js environment the first project that comes to mind is of course mongoDB. I am no database expert, it strikes me as a decent solution, but it might not be the best tool for the job with simple projects. Also It complicates the process of deployment, and setup as another application besides node needs to be installed. Thats why a simpler solution like [lowdb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb) is sometimes what a project calls for.
