I have a long history of making games in a vanilla js style in which I am writing everything from the ground up. I do like that approach, but the draw back is that it is time consuming. Another part of me wants to just work with what is out there to begin with, and just focus on whatever it is that sets my project apart from the epic ton of games that are out on the internet all ready. So That being said I have been focusing in on [phaser](http://phaser.io/) as my first major HTML game framework to help me speed things along on game prototypes.

## Why Phaser?

For one it is popular, and thus also well supported. Also so far it seems to have all the features I can think of that I would want if I where to ask the time to write my own framework, which I am not going to do. Speaking of not making a game framework, yes that is the major reason why I have been looking into phaser. I have nothing against the other mindset about this, there are good reason to write everything from the floor up, but the appeal here is of course to save time.
