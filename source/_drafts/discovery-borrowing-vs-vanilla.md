I once thought about writing my own static site generator, but then I thought "That will take allot of time, and that is probably something that has been done all ready, why don't I check out what's out there first". After that I found out about hexo.io, as well as some others I would like to try some time.

For a long time I have been guilty of taking the time to write my own code to do just about everything, thankfully I am over that sin now and borrow a lot of code to help save my time. However is it a sin? I know that part of being a good programmer is to be very calculated about how you go about using your time. As such yes it is often silly to spend countless hours to write just another static site generator, task automation framework, or tower defense game when there are all ready so many out there. However some time it sure is not as well. 

So I thought it would be a good idea to put down some of my ideas with this into writing.

## Go Vanilla JS!

Okay here are my reasons why I am compelled to write my own JavaScript.

### javaScript as a mental exercise.

If the intent is eduction, of course it makes sense to write your own code for a certain something even if it is something that has already been done to death. There are thousands of people that go for a run every day, or at least fairly regular frequency, does that mean no one should exercise because it has been done before? If actively practicing javaScript on a regular day to day bases is a kind of mental exercise then it is something that should also be done so simply for this reason alone.

### To become a better programer you must, well, program

### Software licensing.

Can't find an open source alternative to a proprietary app, or plug-in? Then re-inventing the wheel makes sense for the sake of giving people that option.

It's also nice to have your copyright declaration on the top of every file, and have the legal right for it to be there. If this is the case then the only person that needs to be payed is you, and you alone in the event that you start to make a little money.

### Coming up with a truly original idea is pretty hard isn't it?

I have a few things ratting around that may be truly unique ideas. Yet again maybe not, maybe I have just not preformed the correct Google search query yet. In any case many of these ideas would take a few months or even years of my life just to get to the point where I have a functional working proof of concept, let alone a solid finished product. Some of them are really hard too, I would say to the point where things are at currently with automation. As such it makes sense to code things that have been done before, otherwise only a very small group of people that have what it takes to kick the can forward for real would code.

### If you want a job done right you need to do it yourself.

I can get this. When I borrow code I end up with a product where all my dependences follow different coding styles. It's would be nice if everything was written in a nice, clean uniform coding style, and it just happened to be mine for better or worse.

### Finding an original spin.

Considering that coming up with a truly original idea is pretty hard, often originality comes in the form of doing your own spin on something that has been done before. Facebook was not the first social network, but it took off, and made an epic amount of money in the process of doing so.
