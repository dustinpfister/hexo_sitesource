Because of the relationship with initialization methods of State Objects and the start method of the StateManager in [phaser](http://phaser.io), it occurred to me that this is something that needs it's own post.

## Some background

So if you do not know a thing or two about phaser you might want to read [some of my other posts](/categories/phaser/), or glance over the [official API DOCS](http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/index) on the topic before hand, this post mainly has to do with State Objects, and there relationship with the StateManager in Phaser. So some background knowledge on State machines in phaser would be needed before hand.
