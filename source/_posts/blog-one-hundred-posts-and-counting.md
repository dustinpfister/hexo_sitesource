This is my 100th blog post, and as such I wanted to just write something that is a milestone of sorts in terms of how things are going with this site. So far at 100 posts, it seems like I am just beginning to gain some ground with Google's Search Engine Result Pages (SERP). The site is Still not getting much traffic, but that is to be expected sense I am still not spaming my content anywhere on social media (yet). Also I am running into many challenges that I need to overcome in order for this site to actually be something of interest to people.

## One Hundred Blog Posts is just the beginning

It has not been a year yet sense I started writing this blog, so I am still just starting out in the grand scheme of things when it comes to doing this. Thinking in terms of powers of ten the next step from here is one thousand posts, as I approach that I will suspect I will really begin to start to gain some real traction.

## Mostly writing about javaScipt for now.

So far just about every post on my site has something to do with [javaScipt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). It is a [github pages site](https://pages.github.com/) anyway, so it makes sense to keep the content relevant to the use of github. It is also a personal blog, so I guess I could write about just about anything I want to. For now I mostly only break away from writing about javaScipt to make this kind of post, but I still do not really have a clear identity for this site.

## keywords in google search

As of this post my best preforming post is the [one I wrote on jimp](/2017/04/10/nodejs-jimp/) both in terms of impressions as well as clicks through to this site. I am getting over 2000 impressions, and some 100 clicks a month with just that one post. Still from what I have read that kind of performance is not that great.

From studying the content of that post, and doing a little keyword research I can see why it is doing well. It is a combination of repetition of the term JIMP in the body of the post, combined with outbound links to related sites of interest that I think is doing the trick. I found [this great post](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors) that explains a lot of the factors that goggle does (or might) take into consideration when determining page rank.

## Outgoing links seem to help

Whenever I write about something like jimp for instance I provide an [outgoing link](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp) to a majoy page of interest such as the [npm package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp).

## keyword conflict seems to have an impact as well

So jimp is an acronym for "JavaScript Image Manipulation Program", at least that is what I was writing about in my post that is doing well. However there is also a song that was written put out by a group from Saturday night live called "[Jizz In My Pants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXfHLUlZf4)" that was received well over one hundred million views sense 2008.

{% 4pXfHLUlZf4% }

Also it turns out that there are [other software projects](http://www.chem.tamu.edu/jimp/index.html) that go by the term jimp. it seems there is a program that was made in the past that has something to do with molecules. I have not looked into it in detail, but yes there are many other things going on with that keyword and it looks like I am manging to rank well with it.

To sum up keyword conflict can be a good thing as it can seem to help with rank. The term seems to get a whole lot of traffic each month, and to rank high with it is a good thing for sure.

## length of posts

From what I have read there seems to be a whole lot of chatter about the length of posts, and that they should be at least some 300 words, and preferably over 1000. So far I cant confirm that content length makes a big difference. Many posts of mine are below 300 words, and seem to be doing okay relative to everything else. In addition my longest post is not getting any traffic at all, as such for the moment I am not seeing a direct correlation between length and performance in SERP pages.

Still longer posts might result in hitting more keywords, but in any case what really matters is the nature of the content itself, short, or long.

## Write about Stuff that people actually use, and search for.

When I was first starting out I had no idea what I was doing. To this day I still consider myself somewhat of a novice when it comes to writing content. Some of my oldest posts have to do with random things that come to mind about some game mechanic in a game I was developing. 

Then I got the idea that it is silly to write about something that only I might be searching for, so I started wring about other peoples javaScript projects rather than my own. However I was not taking into account popularity of projects, as such some would do okay, and others would just be yet another dead post. 

Now I know better I use tools like [google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=javascript%20example,javascript%20game,javascript%20tutorials,javascript%20code,javascript%20hello%20world) to know that I should say "javaScipt code example" rather than just "javaScipt example" when referring to a code example of something.

for example:

So here is the javaScipt code example of using an object.

```js
var obj = {foo:'bar'};
console.log(obj.foo); // 'bar'
```

I also look into other factors that help me gain some incite if something is worth writing about or not, such as how many stars the project has on github.

## To 1000 posts!

I aim to do it, it might take years, or maybe even just a few months if I go nuts with this. In any case I think I might write more posts like this when a certain major milestone post number like this comes along.
