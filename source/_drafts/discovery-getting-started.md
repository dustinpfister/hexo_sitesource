This is my twenty fifth blog post for my [personal github pages site](https://dustinpfister.github.io/), and as such I wanted to do something special. So I thought I would write a post that will be the first of what will be a series of posts on discovery. Discovery seems to be a good word to label a certain something that is not really about javaScript, or any language for that matter, but a certain other something that is needed once you developed a half way decent coding ability.

## What is discovery

If you have spent a great deal of time at stackoverflow, or r/learnjavascript like I have, you may eventuality start to discover patterns with the posts that you read every day. One such pattern that I have noticed is that a lot of new developers ask what it is that they should move onto next after completing a course of study of some kind. That is they have developed a certain degree of ability when it comes with javaScript, but do not really know what to do with it.

This is where discovery comes into play, and I have come to prefer to use the word discovery rather than creativity. The reason why is because I like to think that what it is that I am developing all ready exists in a theoretical sense, and I am merely discovering something that is a certain possibility out of a total finite range. So in other words, I am not really creating, I am discovering.

## Base two numbers example

To help better explain what I mean by this, take a moment to think about how all data is stored on a non volatile data storage medium of a computer. Thats right, it's all binary data. If you are a half way decent programmer, you should know your base two numbers pretty well by now, at least to the point that you know the possible value range of say a byte of data.

```js
console.log(Math.pow(2,8)); // 256
```

A single byte of a data has 256 possible values,
