# Privacy Policy

Updated: 07-18-2019

This is my current standing Privacy Policy for [dustinpfister.github.io](https://dustinpfister.github.io/), the github pages powered blog by Dustin Pfister a self taught javaScript developer the provides free javaScript, nodejs, and general tech related content for free to visitors. However there are a few Privacy concerns with what I am doing with javaScript and cookies on this site, mainly with [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics), and [Google Adsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AdSense).

## Cookies Policy

This website uses [cookie files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie). A cookie is a small text file that can be used to store personal preferences that you might set, however it can also be used as a way to store a reference value locally on your computer that can be used as a way to tracking. On this web site I do not do much of anything with cookies, however third party services that I use do. 

### Google advertising cookies

Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a Google partner's website, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser.

Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.

Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated). (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting [www.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).)

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a way for me to get some general information about the people that visit my website such as the general areas in which they live, what pages they visit, and so forth. No personal information is collected from Google Analytics that can be used by me or anyone else for that matter to know specific details about who you are. Every visitor is a number not a name and is a fair way of gaining insight about the audience of a website.

### Opt-out of Google Analytics

If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics it is possible to do so with this [browser add on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
