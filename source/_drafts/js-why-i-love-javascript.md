This should have been my first post with [this blog](/), but hey better late than never. So yes it is a good idea to write a post outlining why I have chosen JavaScript as my programing environment, and why I like it so much. These things do matter very much, considering that it is something that eats up a whole lot of my free time that could be spent doing something else, so here it goes.

## I am not an Elitist.

First and for most, the main reason why I got into javaScript in the first place was because it struck me as a non elitist programing language. It is a language that is designed for people that considerer themselves to be unsophisticated programmers, but still want to have a way preform certain programming tasks. I don't have to worry about being perfect, I can approach programing with a degree of informality and focus more on just getting together a feature complete proof of whatever concept I am trying to put together. In short it allows for a certain kind of freedom in programing that allows for me to quickly get the bottom line of what it is that I have in mind.

## javaScript is NOT a low level language.

If I want to get into low level programing I will start teaching myself something like C, and start pulling my hair out at an alarming rate. In order to do low level programing I think that I need to have a certain kind of mindset in order to pull it off successfully. People do change now and then, but for the moment I do not see it happening in my future. However high level programing in contrast is something that I am doing now, although as that of a hobbyist, I can see myself becoming more fluid and professional with it.

There are reasons why javaScript has succeeded where Java has failed, I would say it has to do in part with a usability factor of sorts. If you want to do low level programing fine, have at it, and thank you very much if you pull it off well on a project that I use all the time. 

I suppose you can do high level programing tasks with a low level language in some situations, but in many cases I would say that it is a kind of killing a fly with a howitzer kind of situation. when it comes to the idea of soft coding, often a language like JavaScript is an appropriate choice.


## High level programing is a different kind of animal, that is more fluid, and less rigid.

## I like having a closer connection to how the mind works, rather than a computer.

## I am getting old.
