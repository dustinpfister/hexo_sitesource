Hexo [helpers](https://hexo.io/api/helper.html) are one of many extensions in [hexo](https://hexo.io/) that allow for the extension of functionality in hexo. There are extensions for [generating files](/2018/01/04/hexo-generators/), adding html from markdown files with [tags](/2017/02/04/hexo-tags/), and a wide range of other options when [making a script or plug-in for hexo](/2018/01/03/hexo-plugins/). However in this post I will be focusing on useing helpers that are used [when making a theme](/2017/04/17/hexo-theme-start/) for hexo.
