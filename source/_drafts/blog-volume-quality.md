So I started writing a blog about two months ago, and so far I can say I am getting much of any trafic. That is to be expected though considering that I have not done any kind of promotion work, and I have just stared finding out what organic traffic, and Search Engine Optimization is. 

For now I am more focused on what I can do to improve organic traffic, that is people clicking threw to my blog by just simply preforming a certain search query, and clicking threw to my site because it was on the first page. So far it seems like part of improving that is by knowing what kind of content to write in the first place 

For example with my post on [reading files in hexo](http://dustinpfister.github.io/2017/02/13/hexo-readfile/), I have found that when I do a Google search for the phrase "reading files in hexo" the post comes up on the first page right there on position number 1 out of 113,000 results. So it would seem that I am doing something right, but so far only when people search that phrase.
