So you have a bunch of files in a folder, and you want to do something involving the content of each file. You might only want to bother with a certain kind of file, and you might want to know each filename. well one npm package that I have found that helps a whole lot with that is node-dir.

<!-- more -->

# fs.readdir

# node-dir

```
$ npm install node-dir --save
```
