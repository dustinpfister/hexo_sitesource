Quickly throwing together a simple static site with a static site generator like [hexo](/categories/hexo/) is simple enough, but if I do want to make something with a back end system I would want to use something that involves node.js, the hapi framework, and maybe jQuery rather than Angular (I find jQuery easer to work with so far). So in this post I will be covering how to get started with just that. Nothing major, just a single page that posts to a server, but it's a starting point that may or may not progress.
