Do you have any reoccurring nightmares? Mine is one in which I spend my whole life repeating senior year of high school, and it seems I am [not alone with this](https://braindecoder.com/post/why-we-still-have-school-anxiety-dreams-1336233928) as it is very common. Back in 2015 I was [at Buffalo Game Space](https://buffalogamespace.com/misc/index), and was participating in a game jam in which nightmares where the theme. As such I started work on a game I came to call "Forever Stupid", I did not get far with it, and the high point of it was one of my silly animations I made of a radio active knight riding a chicken (yes you read that right) . The project was shelfed, and has been collecting dust at my git-hub account sense.

Fast forward to early 2017 and I find myself in a situation in which I feel as though I have accomplished absolutely nothing, not just with game development, but well, everything. Which may very well explain the nightmares, but that is off topic with what I am driving at here. So anyway to help remedy this problem I thought it might be a good idea to try something novel with they way i have been pursuing things. It involved lots of changes in myself that I don't care to get into here, but also choosing four unfinished game prototypes that I promised to myself that I would fully develop into feature complete projects. When looking threw my old prototypes on github, thats when I cam across "Forever Stupid" and thought that maybe it should be one of the four games.


## The Nightmare

The way I experience the nightmare is that I am the age that I am now (33), but still a senior at high school. I graduated back in 2002, so that would mean that I was held back some 15 times in the dream. As such here I am, this 33 year old weirdo in class with people approaching that of half my age, still managing to just not quite get that book report on Macbeth quite right.
