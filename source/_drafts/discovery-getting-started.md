This is my twenty fifth blog post for my [personal github pages site](https://dustinpfister.github.io/), and as such I wanted to do something special. So I thought I would write a post that will be the first of what will be a series of posts on discovery. Discovery seems to be a good word to label a certain something that is not really about javaScript, or any language for that matter, but a certain other something that is needed once you developed a half way decent coding ability.

## What is discovery

If you have spent a great deal of time at stackoverflow, or r/learnjavascript like I have, you may eventuality start to discover patterns with the posts that you read every day. One such pattern that I have noticed is that a lot of new developers ask what it is that they should move onto next after completing a course of study of some kind. That is they have developed a certain degree of ability when it comes with javaScript, but do not really know what to do with it.

This is where discovery comes into play, and I have come to prefer to use the word discovery rather than creativity.
