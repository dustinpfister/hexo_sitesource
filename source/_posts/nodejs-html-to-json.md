I have been writing a javaScript blog for a little under a year now, and would like to have some tools at my disposal that will help me improve the quality of the content in my posts.

So I wanted to make a simple tool to run threw all of my blog posts that have been parsed into html, and find certain values such as word count for my posts. So I wanted to find some kind of javaScript project that I can use in my CLI tool that would help easily turn some html into a javaScript object that I can then work with. I found a few projects that work nice, but settled in on something called [html-to-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-json).
