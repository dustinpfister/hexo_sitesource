One of the great things about writing a blog on javaScript is that there is never a shortage of things to write about. It's not like I have to write about a single line of products, form a single brand, and as such there is only so much to cover until I start repeating myself. With javaScript there is an ocean of content potential that is to be taped into, but that can also be my undoing.

I find myself torn in a great many different directions, to help I thought I might work out my thoughts on this in the form of a post, so here it goes.

* Writing content that might rank well in organic search

* Writing content that might help me get a job.

* Writing content that is helpful to others.

* Writing content that I want to write about.

* Writing content that will help me remember things I have figured out.
