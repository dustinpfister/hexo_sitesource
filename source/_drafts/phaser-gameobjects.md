Game objects are what I place into a phaser world to make a game happen. Game Objects are Sprites, Graphics, Text, Images, and anything to that effect that all share a common set of values. [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) has many such objects, that all use a different set of components between them.

This post covers everything that I have written about in relation to game objects in phaser, as such this post will get updated a lot as time goes by.

## The list of Game Objects

check out the [2.6.2 list of game objects](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/src/gameobjects) at the github repo.  last I checked there are in total some 17 game objects. However You really only need to be proficient with a few of them to start doing cool things with phaser.

### Graphics

This is what you want to know about if you aim to make on the fly graphics without the use of external assets. That is that I can be used as an alternative to having sprite sheets. These game objects have all kinds of properties, and methods for making graphics by way of code, point data, ect. Be sure to check out my [main post on graphics](/2017/10/21/phaser-graphics/) to get started right away.
