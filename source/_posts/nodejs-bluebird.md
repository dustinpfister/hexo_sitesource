Today I will be writing about the npm package [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird), which is a fully featured featured promise library for [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). There is built in support for promises in node.js as well in any version that is up to spec with [ES2015+ javaScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-promise-objects), so I will see about how bluebird compares to native promise support.
