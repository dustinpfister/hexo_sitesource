When I was a senior in high school, I was taking a studio art class as an elective. At the time I was also taking a class on computer programing, and a tech class, along with the usual math class. As such everything kind of blended together a bit, and I started taking a conceptual approach to my artwork.

Much of my work ended up involving a [Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) like grid. As such at some point I had a thought about the finite limits of 2d imagery, I can't say why, it just poped in there one day. At the time I was not the brightest student when it came to simple math, if I was just a bit more up to speed with powers I would have my answers with certain low resolution grids, but I did not given it much thought, and moved on with things.

## Finding my answer years later

I never stopped actively practicing math, and programing. Over the years my ability at math slowly built up. In time the answer came, along with it. Yes it is just a matter of understating powers, it's very simple to me now.
