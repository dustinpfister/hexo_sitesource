Now that I have a decent understanding of a certain programing environment I find myself facing a new kind of problem with respect to what it is that I want to do with my coding ability, that is why I stared the [discovery category](/categories/discovery/) of [this site](/). Anyway in my efforts to find a remedy to this problem I have come across the concept of something called a [deterministic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system). Which is a kind of [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) in which there is no randomness, each state is predictable.

Think of it this way, a deterministic system is more like a movie than that of a video game, but it is not just a fixed collection of frames. Each frame is the result of some kind of procedure, and although each frame is the same every time given the same time index value, this is only true if the initial state is the same. I can play around with the initial state values, changing the outcome of all the frames of the movie.
