I just recently wrote a post on the node.js powered html template engine called pug, and mentioned that I have some experience working with ejs, which So far I seem to like the best when it come to doing this sort of thing in a node.js environment. However so far I have not wrote a post on ejs.

## Why EJS

EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript and it I see it as an enhanced HTML. It differs from the syntax used in pug and markdown in the sense that it might not be a clean language, but it more closely resembles tired yet true plain old Hyper Text.

## Getting stared with the EJS npm package

Probably one of the best ways to work with ejs would be to use [the ejs npm package on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs). I assume as always with these kinds of posts that you have a background with javaScript, and have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and it's package manager npm installed on your computer.
