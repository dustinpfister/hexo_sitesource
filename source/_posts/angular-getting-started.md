When I started this blog I knew that sooner or later I would have to get started with [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), as a javaScirpt dev I feel as though I have to regardless if I want to or not. Because angular is a pretty complex project this will be the first of many posts, so I made a repo called [test_angular](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_angular) that will contain all of the demos for angular.

## Running my demos locally

You might want to play around with the demos locally. If so it is just a matter of cloning them down, installing depedacies, and running the server.js file. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_angular
$ cd test_angular
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Doing so will give you and index of all of my demos when you do to localhost:3000 in the browser. The demo I will be covering in this post is 'first'.
