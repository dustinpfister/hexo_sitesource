# header

I started this folder as a place to park any and all work that has to do with the header image for the website. This is something that I have been meaning to do for a long time as I have not changed the header image in years, and the current image does not really express the over all theme of the website.

## Header image location

The two main file locations of interest are:

* banner_yyyy.png files at /themes/landscape/source/css/images
* the self_128.png file at /source/img

## css updates

* update 'banner-url' var in file  '_variables.styl'  at /themes/landscape/source/css
