Of course it is in my best interest as a web developer to get people to not be interested in website builder automation services like [wix](). Yet again maybe it is, if we are talking consulting services rather than actual development.

## The Good.

### Quick, and easy account setup

I just loged in with my facebook account, selected a theme, then clicked, and draged a bit. After no more than a few minutes I had a basic site published at a sub-domain of wixsite.com.

### Zero dollars a month option

This is very important for me. Even if hosting is only seven dollars a month, that is sever dollars a month to much if I am not making any money with it. Luckly there are plenty of hosting companys that provide a free option and wix is one such company.

### No advertisements on the zero a month plan



## The Bad

### Heavy relience on 

<!--
## Why hire a pro

## Why use a site builder

Pros:

* You can log in via facebook

* Zero dollars a month option

* No ads with the zero dollar a month option

Cons:

# Do not have full control over layout
# No backend programing
