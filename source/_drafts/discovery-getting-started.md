This is my twenty fifth blog post for my [personal github pages site](https://dustinpfister.github.io/), and as such I wanted to do something special. So I thought I would write a post that will be the first of what will be a series of posts on discovery. Discovery seems to be a good word to label a certain something that is not really about javaScript, or any language for that matter, but a certain other something that is needed once you developed a half way decent coding ability.

## What is discovery

If you have spent a great deal of time at stackoverflow, or r/learnjavascript like I have, you may eventuality start to discover patterns with the posts that you read every day. One such pattern that I have noticed is that a lot of new developers ask what it is that they should move onto next after completing a course of study of some kind. That is they have developed a certain degree of ability when it comes with javaScript, but do not really know what to do with it.

This is where discovery comes into play, and I have come to prefer to use the word discovery rather than creativity. The reason why is because I like to think that what it is that I am developing all ready exists in a theoretical sense, and I am merely discovering something that is a certain possibility out of a total finite range. So in other words, I am not really creating, I am discovering.

## Base two numbers example

To help better explain what I mean by this, take a moment to think about how all data is stored on a non volatile data storage medium of a computer. Thats right, it's all binary data. If you are a half way decent programmer, you should know your base two numbers pretty well by now, at least to the point that you know the possible value range of say a byte of data.

```js
console.log(Math.pow(2,8)); // 256
```

A single byte of a data has 256 possible values, that is there are only 256 possible states that a byte can have, and thats it, it is not infinite. If I add another byte the range of possibilities jumps up to 65,536 if I double it again to four bytes it increases into the billions at 4,294,967,296. As I keep adding bytes the range of possibilities starts to get into some ridiculously large finite numbers, but they are still just that finite. 

Every possible combination of ones and zeros in say 13kb of data can be considered a kind of index value that all ready exists. When you create something that can be stored within 13kb of data, you are not really creating something, but discovering something that was all ready there, as a theoretical possibility within a certain magnitude.
