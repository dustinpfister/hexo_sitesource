## The ng-controller directive

The other directive that I am using in this demo is the ng-controller directive, which attachs a controller class to the element. This is a key feature of the MVC design of angular, which will become clearer in additional future posts. For now just know that the string 'Hello World' in my javaScript is independent from my html, and any change to the string will effect the view of it. That is I do not have to make a change, then go to update my html.
