Hello My name is Dustin, I am a self educated javaScript hobbyist with some ten years of experience. I have found that I enjoy writing javaScript related content for my site here at github pages, and will likely continuing expanding and updating my content here for what it is worth.

If you have found a post of mine useful, great!  My aim at this point is to provide a more supportive role for fellow javaScript developers, rather than working on actual real projects first hand. However that might change at any moment.

## Contact

Best way to go about doing that would be by e-mail, or in the disqus comments of a post that is relevant to you. I do also have a twitter account, but I am not so active there as of yet
