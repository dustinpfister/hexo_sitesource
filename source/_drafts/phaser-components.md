## How many components are there in phaser?

As of 2.6.2 it looks like there are some 23 components thar are in use for veriause things to work with in phaser.

## InputEnabled

This is by far one of the most important components to know about in phaser. It allows for me to set up input handling for a certain display object that uses this component (Sprites, Graphics, ect).
