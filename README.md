# hexo_sitesource

This will be the source code of my github pages site.

## API keys

What is not stored in the repository is my API keys. As such I keep a file called apikeys.json in the root path that looks something like this:

```js
{
 
    "fake-site-one" : "a032ff37de8c",
    "fake-site-two" : "fa7200b8cd68"
 
}
```
