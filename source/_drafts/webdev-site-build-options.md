## All in one hosting, and user friendly self web building services.

There are a number of companies that provide services that are not really just straight web hosting, or web development services, but a combination of the two. They also handle things in a why that make developing a site very easy for people who do not have advanced working knowledge of web development languages, and site building software.

There are a few sites that do this kind of thing, but for now the ones that I have done the most research into are Wix, and Weebly.

### Weebly

- progressive enhancement : pass

### Wix

One of my main complaints with wix is that they depend to heavily of JavaScript.




## Static site generators

### Hexo





## Content Management Systems

### BoldGrid

### keystone


<!--
So far my favorite site like this is Weebly, I do not have any kind of brand loyalty, just a few technical reasons when compared to wix that mainly have to do with a concept known as [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement). When I disable JavaScript and go to a site that is developed using wix I am greeted with a blank white page.
