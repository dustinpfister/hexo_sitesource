I am sure I am not alone when I say that I love [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The ability to create complex full stack web applications with a single uniform scripting language for both the front, and back end is really changing things for the better if you ask me.

I have already written [a few posts](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/node-js/) on node.js based projects such as [hexo](https://hexo.io), and [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), I realize that I have jumped the gun sort of speak for not throwing together my take on node.js [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) examples. Although I am sure it has been done before many times sense it's release in 2009, I thought I would throw my own together for the hell of it so here it is.

## The simplest vanilla js hello world.

If the aim is to make back end scripts that ultimately spit something out to the standard output of the console, then writing a node.js hello world is as simple as this.

```js
console.log('hello world');
```

yes thats it, just save it as something like myscript.js with your favorite ASCII or Unicode editor then navigate to the working directory.
