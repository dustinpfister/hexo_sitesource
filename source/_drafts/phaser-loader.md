This is a post that servers as a general overview of the asset loader in [phaser](http://phaser.io). As such I am covering most parts of it in general, and providing links to all of my other relevant content on asset loading in a phaser project. As such this post should serve as a good starting point about loading assets, but not with phaser in general, I have a post on that [here](/2017/10/04/phaser-getting-started/).

## Conclusion

My [posts on phaser](/categories/phaser/) asset loading, and on phaser in general is expanding vary fast, as such this post, and many others on phaser will be expanded on, and revised as time goes on. Phaser is a very advanced project, and it might be possible that I will end up with 100+ posts on phaser alone.
