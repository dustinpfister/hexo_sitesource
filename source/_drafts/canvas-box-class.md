You may think that simple 2d games, animations, and the like is a simple trivial matter. Well when compared to 3d, you might be right about that, but a whole lot of things about 2d geometry is often not so trivial. Simple two denominational game physics, are still, well physics, and physics does have this reputation of being kind of hard to follow.

Still 2d is a great place to start when it comes to trying to understand much of what is often called game mechanics.
