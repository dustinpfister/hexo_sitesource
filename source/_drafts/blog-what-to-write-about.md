One of the great things about writing a blog on javaScript is that there is never a shortage of things to write about. It's not like I have to write about a single line of products, form a single brand, and as such there is only so much to cover until I start repeating myself. With javaScript there is an ocean of content potential that is to be taped into, but that can also be my undoing. It is easy to get overwhelmed, as such I thought it might be a good idea to throw together some ideas on this matter.

## Writing content that might rank well in organic search

There is a certain strategy that involved writing content that exists in a sort of sweet spot between popular, and obscure. Where if I write a post that manages to hit that sweet spot my post will rank on the first page of Google search results with respect to certain search phrases relavent to whatever that sweet post may be.

So far I have written some 26 blog posts, out of the total of that sum of posts is [my post](/2017/02/09/api-fixer/) on the [fixer.io](http://fixer.io) free exchange rate JSON api. This post is by far my best preforming post with respect to organic search results, and has been for quite some time now. 

I do not have a clear strategy in place that may help me write this kind of content all the time, but I might not need one. I had no strategy in mind when writing my best preforming post, it just happened by chance. Still it does make sense to try to write that kind of content often, and doing so will be achieved by trying to understand what metrics where involved that led to my post preforming as well as it did, compared to everything else thus far.

* Writing content that might help me get a job.

This strategy should speak for itself, but may need at least a little elaboration. The idea is to just simply look into what it popular in the industry of high level computer programing with the javaScript programing language. Study whatever libraries, frameworks, and so forth are used often, and write blog posts that demonstrate that I have logged time playing around with them. Therefore I have at least a degree of experience with what is typically used in a work setting.

The thing about writing this kind of content is that I am taking time to simple prove that I have what it takes to preform at a job. It's the kind of post that is only intended to try and impress a potential employer. The content may just be yet another post on a certain something that has been covered by other bloggers extensively. I am not writing content that targets a certain area that is under reported, I am also not wringing the kind of content that I want to write about on a personal basis.

* Writing content that is helpful to others.

This is my go to default strategy when I am not sure what the next step is with all of my other strategies listed in this post. One way to go about doing it is to go to an a site like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript), and just start reading the questions that people are posting. After reading a lot of them, I begin to see certain patterns with the kinds of problems people are having with certain things. Then I start writing posts that helps to address those problems.

Often it may be something that is well covered elsewhere, it may, or may not manage to rank well with google, at least for starters. However it is now my solution to a certain problem, that I can now link to in a response to any question in the future that is relevant to the content.

* Writing content that I want to write about.

This is something that I like to do now and then, purely for the obvious reasons why. It might be helpful, it might rank, it may wow an employer and get me a job, if so all of that is just an unintentional by product of just simply writing content that I want to write about simple because it brings me some kind of pleasure. It may be pleasure from helping others, it may not be, any case it is just simply the kind of content that I want to write about.

* Writing content that will help me remember things I have figured out.
