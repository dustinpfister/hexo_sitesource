I often like to think about the differences between lateral, and linear thought.

## Lateral thinking

The word lateral in it's adjective form, means to be of, at, toward, or from the side. However the way that I generally view lateral thinking is being multi-dimensional in your thoughts, that is thinking in all kinds of directions. Not being dogmatic to a single narrow approach, when it comes to finding a solution to a problem. Considering an array of solutions, and weighing up the pros and cons of each, and understating that each one may have a kind of value. For these reason's lateral thinking may often be considered a superior way of thinking when compared to it's counterpart know as linear (or vertical) thinking. However I would not go so far as to jump to that conclusion.

## Linear thinking (AKA Vertical thinking)

Linear is a word that means that something is arranged along a straight line. One way of thinking about it is picking a direction, and staying true to that single course, for better or worse. In many cases this way of thinking may be silly, however in some scenarios actually a better course of action compared to a more lateral approach. For example is it better to be a master of a single trade, or to become a jack of everything? I think most people would agree that it is preferable to become highly proficient at a single thing, than to just have superficial knowledge of a wide range of disciplines. However be it as it may, I would not jump the gun and say that this way of thinking is superior also.
