In [hexo](https://hexo.io/) a [generator](https://hexo.io/api/generator.html) can be used to build files for a static website. It can work with content from the sites blog posts, it can be used in conjunction with *.ejs files to make *.html files, or it can be used to make other plain text files as well.

## What to know before hand.

I assume that you have knowledge of javaScript, html, css, and at least some basic understanding of how to work with the node.js powered static site generator known as hexo. In this post I will just be covering generators, and not scripts and plug-ins in general, I have [a post for that]().
