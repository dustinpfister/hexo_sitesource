This is my 100th blog post, and as such I wanted to just write something that is a milestone of sorts in terms of how things are going with this site. So far at 100 posts, it seems like I am just beginning to gain some ground with Google's Search Engine Result Pages (SERP). The site is Still not getting much traffic, but that is to be expected sense I am still not spaming my content anywhere on social media (yet). Also I am running into many challenges that I need to overcome in order for this site to actually be something of interest to people.

## One Hundred Blog Posts is just the beginning

It has not been a year yet sense I started writing this blog, so I am still just starting out in the grand scheme of things when it comes to doing this. Thinking in terms of powers of ten the next step from here is one thousand posts, as I approach that I will suspect I will really begin to start to gain some real traction.

## keywords in google search

As of this post my best preforming post is the [one I wrote on jimp](/2017/04/10/nodejs-jimp/) both in terms of impressions as well as clicks through to this site. I am getting over 2000 impressions, and some 100 clicks a month with just that one post. Still from what I have read that kind of performance is not that great.

From studying the content of that post, and doing a little keyword research I can see why it is doing well. It is a combination of repetition of the term JIMP in the body of the post, combined with outbound links to related sites of interest that I think is doing the trick. I found [this great post](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors) that explains a lot of the factors that goggle does (or might) take into consideration when determining page rank.

## To 1000 posts!

I aim to do it, it might take years, or maybe even just a few months if I go nuts with this. In any case I think I might write more posts like this when a certain major milestone post number like this comes along.
