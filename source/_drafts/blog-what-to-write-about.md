One of the great things about writing a blog on javaScript is that there is never a shortage of things to write about. It's not like I have to write about a single line of products, form a single brand, and as such there is only so much to cover until I start repeating myself. With javaScript there is an ocean of content potential that is to be taped into, but that can also be my undoing. It is easy to get overwhelmed, as such I thought it might be a good idea to throw together some ideas on this matter.

## Writing content that might rank well in organic search

There is a certain strategy that involved writing content that exists in a sort of sweet spot between popular, and obscure. Where if I write a post that manages to hit that sweet spot my post will rank on the first page of Google search results with respect to certain search phrases relavent to whatever that sweet post may be.

So far I have written some 26 blog posts, out of the total of that sum of posts is [my post](/2017/02/09/api-fixer/) on the [fixer.io](http://fixer.io) free exchange rate JSON api. This post is by far my best preforming post with respect to organic search results, and has been for quite some time now. 

I do not have a clear strategy in place that may help me write this kind of content all the time, but I might not need one. I had no strategy in mind when writing my best preforming post, it just happened by chance. Still it does make sense to try to write that kind of content often, and doing so will be achieved by trying to understand what metrics where involved that led to my post preforming as well as it did, compared to everything else thus far.

* Writing content that might help me get a job.

* Writing content that is helpful to others.

* Writing content that I want to write about.

* Writing content that will help me remember things I have figured out.
