So I started writing a blog about two months ago, and so far I can say I am not getting much traffic. I can't complain though considering that I have not done nothing in terms of promotion work, and I have just stared finding out what organic traffic, and Search Engine Optimization is.

For now I am more focused on what I can do to improve organic traffic, that is people clicking threw to my site by just simply preforming a certain search query, and clicking threw to my site because it was on the first page. So far it seems like part of improving that is by knowing what kind of content to write in the first place 

For example with my post on [reading files in hexo](http://dustinpfister.github.io/2017/02/13/hexo-readfile/), I have found that when I do a Google search for the phrase "reading files in hexo" the post comes up on the first page right there on position number 1 out of 113,000 results. Also according to google search console, some of my posts are in fact showing up on the first page, or at least near it, with a few queries. So it would seem that I am doing something right, but so far only when people search certain phrases relavent to a few of my small collection of posts.

## "Popular, yet obscure" subject matter.

If I write a post about a popular javaScript technology it will get buried in a lengthly stack of content authored by my competition, which is to be expected if it is something popular like angular, jquery, or node.js. Also if I write about something that is to obscure there is a good chance that I will land on the front page, but what is it worth if no one is searching for it?

As such it is important to write about projects that are popular, but not to popular. A sort of sweet spot between known, and unknown. The static site generator hexo might be such an example of this, it is a little obscure in the javaScript world, but not so obscure that no one in the world but me is searching for it.

## High volume, but concise.

So what projects should I post about that are in the sweet spot? Sometimes it's hard to say, so as such I should try to write a whole bunch of posts, on a wide range of projects. Like that of throwing darts, some of them should hit the bullseye if I throw enough times.

## No shortage of ideas when writing about javaScript.

I have plenty of ideas for "darts" if you get what I mean. The great thing about writing about javaScript is that there is always something to write about. It's not like I am writing about a single line of products from a single company where after a while I am just repeating the same stuff over and over. With javaScript there is always something new to learn, it never stops.
