## Hi, my name is Dustin. I like javaScript.

Hello My name is Dustin, I am a self educated javaScript developer with over ten years of experience thus far. I have found that I enjoy writing javaScript related content for my site here at github pages, and will likely continuing expanding and updating my content here.

If you have found a post of mine useful, great. My aim at this point is to provide a more supportive role for fellow javaScript developers, rather than working on actual projects. Still I log plenty of hours writing code examples, so you do not have to. I also do work on the occasional long them project, usually in the form of a game, but also basic node.js powered cli tools 

## Sponsored content

I get the occasional e-mail requesting that I place content written by someone else on this site in exchange for exposure, or site promotion of some kind. Here at dustinpfister.github.io it should be obvious that I am promoting a personal brand of sorts, so all content should be written by me. So if I do ever post sponsored content on this site it will have to be written by me, and also I will need to be payed as it is a service to do so. Although I am not happy with having ads on my site, and am open to the idea of other ways to make money, at this time I am not a big fan of the idea of writing sponsored content. If you think you can convince me otherwise though I do have my e-mail listed below.

## E-mails asking for help on something

I get E-mails now and then asking for help on a certain topic that I have written about on this site. Please understand that I am often busy, or dealing with some kind of life drama outside of programing. Also if it is a post on something that I have not worked with in a while it might no longer be fresh in my mind as well. It would always be best to leave a comment on the post of interest, the more engagement a post receives the greater the interest I will have in improving that posts quality, as well as expanding on that topic when writing new content.
Also if you want me to help you with something that is composed of hundreds, if not thousands of lines of code, once again this is a service that you are asking of me. If it has to do with one of my blog posts, and I have some free time, maybe I can improve or expand that content at some point if you leave a comment. The more attention that a post gets the greater the reason for me to improve that post. Otherwise if you want me to help you with your project I will need to get payed to do so. Simply put I do not work for free, unless I am working for me, or at least something I think is worth the investment if it is an open source project.

## Backlinks

I do not get a lot of comments thus far, but I guess I should write about this anyway. If you want to have a link from my website to yours I ask that the link is relevant to the content of the post that you are linking from. If the subject has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the post I will not allow it. If you are just promoting some kind of software or service and not adding anything to the value of the post in any way, chances are I will not allow it. If it is an obvious copy and past response with a link to a site that with a domain that was just registered today, chances are I will not allow it. However if for example I wrote a post on buffers in nodejs, and you want to link to a post of yours that has to do with nodejs buffers, or at least buffers in general in some way, then changes are I will allow it.

## Contact

Best way to go about doing that would be by leaving a disqus comment in the post that is relevant to your problem, concern, or other inquiry. I do also have a twitter account, but I am not so active there as of yet. If you really do want to e-mail me for some reason best way would be by my gmail account that I will link to here as well.
